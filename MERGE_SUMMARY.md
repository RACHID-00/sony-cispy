# Library Merge Summary

This document summarizes the merge of the old `python_sonycisip2-0.2.5` library with the newer connection aspects from the `bravia-quad-homeassistant` integration.

## What Was Merged

### From `python_sonycisip2-0.2.5` (Old Library, no public github repo, no docs)
- ✅ **Universal API**: Generic `get_feature()` and `set_feature()` methods
- ✅ **Command Discovery**: Full `commands_dict` with all CIS-IP2 commands preserved
- ✅ **Variables**: `variables_dict` for command placeholders preserved
- ✅ **Library Structure**: Clean package structure suitable for distribution

### From `bravia-quad-homeassistant` (New Integration)
- ✅ **Robust Connection Handling**: Command ID tracking with futures
- ✅ **Request/Response Matching**: Proper async future-based response handling
- ✅ **JSON Stream Decoding**: Handles multiple JSON objects in a single read
- ✅ **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for all operations
- ✅ **Notification System**: Feature-specific and general notification callbacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Better exception handling and connection state management
- ✅ **Connection Lifecycle**: Proper async context manager support

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Command ID tracking ensures requests match with correct responses
2. **Performance**: Futures-based approach is more efficient than queue-based
3. **Robustness**: JSON stream decoding handles edge cases better
4. **Flexibility**: Maintains universal API while adding modern async patterns
5. **Developer Experience**: Better error messages and logging

## File Structure

```
sony_cispy/
├── __init__.py          # Package exports
├── client.py            # Main SonyCISIP2 client class
├── constants.py         # Protocol constants
├── commandset.py        # Full CIS-IP2 command dictionary (preserved)
├── variables.py         # Variable placeholders (preserved)
└── README.md            # Usage documentation
```

## Breaking Changes

The new library maintains API compatibility where possible, but:

- **Connection**: Now uses async context manager pattern (optional but recommended)
- **Response Handling**: More reliable but slightly different internal implementation
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.13+ (updated from 3.6+)

## Migration Guide

### Old Library Usage
```python
client = SonyCISIP2(host, port)
await client.connect()
result = await client.set_feature("main.power", "on")
value = await client.get_feature("main.power")
await client.disconnect()
```

### New Library Usage (Same API!)
```python
client = SonyCISIP2(host, port)
await client.connect()
result = await client.set_feature("main.power", "on")
value = await client.get_feature("main.power")
await client.disconnect()
```

### Recommended New Pattern
```python
async with SonyCISIP2(host, port) as client:
    result = await client.set_feature("main.power", "on")
    value = await client.get_feature("main.power")
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Core library structure created
2. ✅ Connection handling merged
3. ✅ Universal API preserved
4. ✅ Command set preserved
5. ✅ Add unit tests
6. ⏳ Add setup.py/pyproject.toml for distribution
7. ⏳ Add more examples
8. ⏳ Add type stubs for better IDE support
