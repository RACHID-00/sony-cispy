## Test Structure

- `conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures and configuration
- `test_client.py` - Tests for the main `SonyCISIP2` client class
- `test_constants.py` - Tests for constants module
- `test_commandset.py` - Tests for command dictionary
- `test_variables.py` - Tests for variables dictionary

## Test Features

All network connections are mocked, so tests can run without requiring a real Sony device. The tests cover:

- Connection handling (success, failure, timeout)
- Command sending and receiving (get_feature, set_feature)
- Notification callbacks
- JSON stream decoding
- Error handling
- Context manager usage
- Command ID generation and wrapping

## Requirements

Tests require the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines without requiring hardware access.
